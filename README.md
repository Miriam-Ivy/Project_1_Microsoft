# Project_1_Microsoft
## Statement of the problem.
Phase 1 - Movie Analysis : We are asked to produce an analysis that will help Microsoft start their new venture into movie production based on viewer ratings.
### Installation
I uploaded the.csv file to my notebook. I was then able to convert / adapt it into a database formula for easy functionality with sqlite3 and made the database connection.
#### Usage.
Because of difficulty in obtaining any dataset, what I had was limited in terms of available data. I was able to cut down the database to 19000 entries by limiting them to those that had average votes above 5. The next step was toreduce the list further down based on vote count being more than 10000 and that yeilded 72 entries. For the final table, i limited it to 5 entries based on the popularity votes the movies had achieved in descending orderregardless of release date.
##### Data Visualization
Matplotlib was imported so as to hepl with this. I used the data from the % movies to rank them on a simple line plot based on the top 5 and highest popularity (%)
###### Contribution.
I was able to give Microsoft a view of the top movies with the hightest popularity within the sample population that was used. From there they can be able to assess the genres the movies fall into so as to assertain the kind of movies they want to produce.
